todos:

- adding transform: scale3d(1,1,1); to the plan solves the 3d bug flicker on the map (bug still persists but on the color of the roof)
- real seats that are reserved should have the same color like in the plan. Also change colors of seats when selecting seats..
- bug: gaps in the left wall 
- try to add again the bottom floor
- bug: in firefox when going to some seats theres a flickering of the side walls
- mobile view
- possibility to click on a seat to select/preview
- possibility to switch between movies/seat plans
- lebels/tooltips on planseats (and also seats?)
